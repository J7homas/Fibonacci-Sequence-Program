# Fibonacci-Sequence-Program

The Fibonacci Sequence Program generates a Fibonacci sequence ending from a user-specified number. The program computes and displays the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, ending at the number entered by the user. It provides a simple and efficient way to explore and generate the Fibonacci sequence for any chosen starting point.
